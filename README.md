# StraightPoop 🚽💩


Straight Poop is an app created to help you locate any restrooms around you and review them so that
other users can know if they are free to use or not and more importantly, clean or not!<br>
This app was created during the Spring Boston Hackathon 2017.

## Release

Straight Poop is still in development and will be available soon on Android and iOS!
The git will be updated once the app is officially online!

## Straight Poop won the Boston Hackathon 🏅! 
The Boston Hackaton is an official hackaton organised by the Major League Hacking (MLH)
